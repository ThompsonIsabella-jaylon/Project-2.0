<div class="Help"> How you can help </div>
<div class="URM"> We cannot wait for change, we must make it. You can donate to various homeshelters and organizations willing to help homeless people. The UASO has it's own charity event but that has now ended. We suggest visiting Union Rescue Mission which is a organization based in Los Angles that helps homeless people and provides shelter for them. Click "URM Website" to go to their website and donate now> </div>
